# Israel-Palestine-War-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains the political bias and sentiment analysis results of the ongoing Israel-Palestine war based on the relevant facebook posts. A variety of methods including Random Forest, Mistral 7B (LLM), DistilRoBERTa-base and LDA were used in this project. This was a client project and I do not have the permission to share the datasets.
