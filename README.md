# Israel-Palestine-War-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains the political bias and sentiment analysis results of the ongoing Israel-Palestine war based on the relevant facebook posts. A variety of methods including Random Forest, Mistral 7B (LLM), DistilRoBERTa-base and LDA were used in this project. The texts were segmented based on political bias (Pro-Israel, Pro-Palestine and Neutral), emotions conveyed and topic. This was a client project and I do not have the permission to share the datasets. The political bias detection methods are outlined in the Method.txt file while the emotion detection menthod is outlined in the Emotion Detection.txt file.
